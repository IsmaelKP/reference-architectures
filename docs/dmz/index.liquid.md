An on-premises network can be connected to a virtual network in Azure by using an Azure VPN gateway. The network boundary between these two environments can expose areas of weakness in terms of security, and it is necessary to protect this boundary to block unauthorized requests. Similar protection is required for applications running on VMs in Azure that are exposed to the public Internet.
