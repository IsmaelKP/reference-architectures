  columns: 4
  description: Running a virtual machine (VM) in Azure involves more moving parts than just the VM itself. Other considerations include networking, load balancers, network security groups (NSGs), and redundancy within a region or across multiple regions.

- title: Build web applications
  description: Azure App Service is a fully managed cloud service for hosting web applications and web APIs. However, most applications require more than just a web tier. For example, a typical application may use a database, cache, or CDN. Other considerations include deployment, diagnostics, and monitoring.

  columns: 2
  description: An on-premises network can be connected to a virtual network in Azure by using an Azure VPN gateway. The network boundary between these two environments can expose areas of weakness in terms of security, and it is necessary to protect this boundary to block unauthorized requests. Similar protection is required for applications running on VMs in Azure that are exposed to the public Internet.
