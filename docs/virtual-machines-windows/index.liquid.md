Running a virtual machine (VM) in Azure involves more moving parts than just the VM itself. Other considerations include networking, load balancers, network security groups (NSGs), and redundancy within a region or across multiple regions.

The patterns &amp; practices group has created a set of reference architectures to address these considerations.
These reference architectures build on each other, starting from deploying a single VM, moving to multiple VMs behind a load balancer, VMs running N-tier applications, and finally multi-region deployments.
